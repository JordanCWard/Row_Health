**Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States**. **In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories** spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. 

Now that theyâ€™ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing budget for the year, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. **As a data analyst at Row Health, your focus is on building visualizations** to enable the marketing team to self-serve insights and regular-cadence reporting.

-   **Optimize Underperforming Products:** Revisit pricing, production, and marketing strategies for subcategories with weak or negative profit margins (e.g., Jerseys, Touring Frames).
-   **Leverage Best-Selling Categories:** Bikes consistently show strong revenue (peaking at $36 million in 2019). Strengthen marketing campaigns and supply chain management around key bike subcategories (Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes) to build momentum.
-   **Tailor Efforts to Top Regions and Customers:** Countries such as France and Germany have higher average revenue per top customer ($13k in France, $10k in Germany). Create targeted promotions or loyalty programs for France and Germany to further increase sales.
