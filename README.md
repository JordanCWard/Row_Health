# <p align="center"> Row Health Campaigns </p>

Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they introduced a range of marketing campaigns covering wellness tips, plan affordability, and preventative care. Row Health offers four plan tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—each featuring different premium levels and claim coverage rates.

The primary goal is to evaluate how Row Health’s 2019 marketing campaigns influence signups for these plan tiers and subsequent patient claims. The outcome involves creating a dashboard and regular-cadence reports that enable the marketing team to independently explore insights and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns over time.

### High-Impact Recommendations:

TBD

-   **Capitalize on High-Margin Items:** Focus on subcategories and categories with the highest profit margins, including Accessories (59% margin), Fenders, Bike Stands, and Tires & Tubes.
-   **Optimize Underperforming Products:** Revisit pricing, production, and marketing strategies for subcategories with weak or negative profit margins (e.g., Jerseys, Touring Frames).
-   **Leverage Best-Selling Categories:** Bikes consistently show strong revenue (peaking at $36 million in 2019). Strengthen marketing campaigns and supply chain management around key bike subcategories (Mountain Bikes, Road Bikes) to build momentum.
-   **Tailor Efforts to Top Regions and Customers:** Countries such as France and Germany have higher average revenue per top customer ($13k in France, $10k in Germany). Create targeted promotions or loyalty programs for France and Germany to further increase sales.
