# <p align="center"> Row Health Campaigns </p>

Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they introduced a range of marketing campaigns covering wellness tips, plan affordability, and preventative care. Row Health offers four plan tiers—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—each featuring different premium levels and claim coverage rates.

The primary goal is to evaluate how Row Health’s 2019 marketing campaigns influence signups for these plan tiers and subsequent patient claims. The outcome involves creating a dashboard and regular-cadence reports that enable the marketing team to independently explore insights and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns over time.

### High-Impact Recommendations:

- **Consolidate Budget Around Low-Cost, High-Performance Campaigns:** Shift more resources toward Campaign 31 (lowest cost per signup at $0.23), Health Awareness (lowest cost per signup at $0.92), and Campaign 14 (CPC $0.00) to capitalize on their high efficiency. Simultaneously, deprioritize or restructure high-cost efforts such as Campaign 5 (cost per signup $1,519.17) and Offer Announcement (cost per signup $69.61).

- **Leverage Silver Plan’s Strong Results:** With the highest number of claims (43,179), highest clicks (794,857), and the lowest cost per signup ($2.42), Silver demonstrates outstanding performance. Expand marketing around Silver’s success stories—like its #HealthyLiving campaign—to boost overall conversions and replicate best practices across other plans.

- **Optimize by State to Balance Cost and Volume:** While NJ dominates in both claims and clicks, it also offers a relatively low cost per signup ($4.10). Further increase investment in NJ to maximize high-volume returns. At the same time, investigate ways to reduce costs in high-expense states like FL ($1,011.84 per signup) or shift focus to DC, which delivers the lowest CPC ($0.03).

- **Refine Platinum’s Signup Funnel:** Despite a strong click-through rate (11.27%) and a low CPC ($0.04), Platinum yields a 0% signup rate, pushing its cost per signup up to $490.77. Conduct a thorough funnel analysis to identify drop-off points, optimize landing pages, and tailor messaging (e.g., “Affordable Plans,” “#CoverageMatters”) to convert curious prospects into actual signups.
